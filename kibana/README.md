# What is Kibana?

Kibana is an open source analytics and visualization platform designed to work with Elasticsearch. You use Kibana to search, view, and interact with data stored in Elasticsearch indices. You can easily perform advanced data analysis and visualize your data in a variety of charts, tables, and maps.

## Running in Development Mode

In the given example, Kibana will a attach to a user defined network (useful for connecting to other services (e.g. Elasticsearch)). If network has not yet been created, this can be done with the following command:

```console
$ docker network create somenetwork
```

*Note: In this example, Kibana is using the default configuration and expects to connect to a running Elasticsearch instance at http://localhost:9200*

Run Kibana

```console
$ docker run -d --name kibana --net somenetwork -p 5601:5601 kibana:tag
```

Kibana can be accessed by browser via `http://localhost:5601` or `http://host-ip:5601`

## Running in Production Mode
